# Bitcoin-Investment-Analysis
A comparative analytics project evaluating **Bitcoin** as an investment asset against **Gold, NASDAQ, USD, and Oil**.  
The study explores risk-adjusted returns, volatility, diversification potential, and investor sentiment using **Python-based financial analytics**.  

## Problem Statement  
Is Bitcoin a good investment compared to traditional assets?  
This project investigates:  
- How do Bitcoin’s returns compare to other investments?  
- How risky is Bitcoin relative to traditional markets?  
- Does Bitcoin improve portfolio diversification?  
- How does investor sentiment (fear) influence Bitcoin risk?  

## Methods  
- **Data (2017–2021):**  
  - Bitcoin historical prices  
  - NASDAQ Composite Index  
  - US Dollar Index Futures  
  - Brent Crude Oil Futures  
  - Gold Futures  
- **Techniques Applied:**  
  - Sharpe Ratio → risk-adjusted return  
  - Annualized Volatility → daily price fluctuation  
  - Correlation Analysis → portfolio diversification  
  - VIX Sentiment Index → fear-driven investor behaviour  

## Key Findings  
- **High Sharpe Ratio:** Bitcoin outperformed traditional assets on a risk-adjusted basis.  
- **High Volatility:** Bitcoin was the most volatile asset, showing strong price swings.  
- **Weak Correlations:** Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets indicates diversification benefits.  
- **Fear Factor:** VIX showed that investor panic strongly drives Bitcoin volatility.  

## Conclusion  
Bitcoin is a **high-risk, high-return asset** that offers diversification potential but is highly sensitive to market sentiment. It may fit **risk-tolerant investors** seeking growth opportunities.
